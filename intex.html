                        Event management is executing an entire event, including event planning, logistics, budgeting, vendor management, marketing, mapping the event agenda, inviting speakers, setting up registration, overseeing execution, and more. For event planners, the lifecycle of an event would vary based on the scope of the event they are managing. It would also vary based on the event mode, i.e., whether they plan a virtual, hybrid, or onsite event. Although the specifics of the event planning business might differ, event management involves some common aspects at its core.
